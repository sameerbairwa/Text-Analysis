This is a sample project, built to analyse the working and performance fo multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms over amazon review dataset, for sentiment analysis

## Dataset used:
Amazon Review Dataset (Electronics) <br>
***https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html***

## Algorithms Applied:
* *Machine Learning* <br>
  - Support Vector Machine <br>
  - Naive Bayes <br>
  - Decision Tree <br>
* *Deep Learning* <br>
  - Long Short Memory Networks (LSTM) <br>
  - Convolution Neural Networs (CNN) <br>
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) <br>
  - Recursive Neural Network (Rec NN) <br>

To support the working of the deep learning algorithms embeddings file used: <br>
